Obedience to Authority by Stanley Milgram is a gripping account of a psychological experiment on obedience, one that is now considered a modern classic. The 1963 experiment, undertaken with a population of participants from Connecticut, outlines the extent that an adult will follow orders. In the experiment, a volunteer assumes the role of a teacher and a pre-designated actor assumes the role of a learner in which the teacher is to administer electric shocks of increasing magnitude with every wrong answer that the learner gives in response to a memory test.
