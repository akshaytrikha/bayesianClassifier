As social animals, humans rely on outward appearances as a way to communicate and express our internal identity. This lets us communicate personality and even intentions. While not all human interactions are face to face, we can assume that there is always a person behind every text message, email, or phone call. However, with the advent of technologies such as article-generating software and automated chat bots we begin to question exactly who or what we are interacting with. This is a predicted by Norbert Wiener, author of The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society, as he explores the similarities between humans and intelligent systems. With the possibility of human intelligence being present in a new form, intellectuals such as N. Katherine Hayles, author of How We Became Posthuman, fear that we will begin equating interactions with inorganic computers to real human interaction.  In 1950, Alan Turing attempted to define thought and intelligence of interactions with machinery versus humans by creating the Turing Test.  This test is based upon on the ability of a human subject to distinguish a human and a robot, given a command line interface. While a machine may pass a Turing Test, meaning a human and the machine can create equivalent interactions to that of a human and a human, Hayles and Wiener disagree on whether or not we can equate these two interactions as one. The piece Pollution Robot by Juan Downey, a digital sculptor, exemplifies a Turing Test and creates a lens for us to assess how Wiener prioritizes information and output while Hayles values embodiment and material. By analyzing the interactions with Pollution Robot, we can see how Hayles and Wiener disagree on whether or not the embodiment of information is relevant in relation to an interaction.
