Where does the mind end and the body begin? Body and mind are deeply entangled entities, as we struggle with appearances and autonomy in our relationships and identities. Still, the frame of Cybernetics provides the mind-body relationship with another dimension as society progresses toward the increasingly technological world that author N. Katherine Hayles describes in her 1999 book How we Became Posthuman. It is plausible that one day soon it will be possible to merge human consciousness into a manmade shell, and we will need to address how identity, memories, and bodies change as their link becomes more ambiguous and less permanent. To Hayles, this possibility of what she calls "erasure of embodiment" holds the potential for a horrifying future in which the body is ripped from identity, no longer able to serve as a foundation for the self (Hayles 4). Ridley Scott's 1982 movie Blade Runner is set in one such possible future, where the Tyrell Corporation produces humanlike entities called replicants to perform off-world slave labor. The character of Rachael is introduced to the viewer as a secretary for the head of the Tyrell Corporation, but it is soon revealed that although she has spent her whole life believing she is human, she is a replicant as well. The character Rachael's struggle with self-definition and consent upon learning she is a replicant illustrates how erasure of embodiment leads to a fractured sense of identity and autonomy, as described in Katherine Hayles' How We Became Posthuman.
