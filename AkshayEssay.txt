Obedience to Authority by Stanley Milgram is a gripping account of a psychological
experiment on obedience, one that is now considered a modern classic. The 1963 experiment,
undertaken with a population of participants from Connecticut, outlines the extent that an adult will
follow orders. In the experiment, a volunteer assumes the role of a teacher and a pre-designated actor
assumes the role of a learner in which the teacher is to administer electric shocks, which aren’t actually
real, of increasing magnitude with every wrong answer that the learner gives in response to a memory
test. Hilary Bok, a philosopher, in her 1996 paper, "Acting Without Choosing", attempts to explain
Milgram’s subjects’ behaviours with a theory of a "decisional conflict" - a struggle to decide between
obeying and disobeying (Bok 178). Milgram’s main claim from his research is that a person will obey
an authoritative figure’s orders in high pressure situation, even if the orders cause direct harm to other
people because they transition into an "agentic state" - a state where a person acts as an agent to
someone else’s commands (Milgram 133). Bok presents that her argument about a decisional conflict
is within oneself and does not mention any external pressures, however in the case of Milgram’s
experiment there is also an authoritative figure present that imposes an additional pressure which
influences subjects’ decisions. Bok’s theory seems to make sense in explaining Milgram’s results but
we risk hindering our understanding of how her theory actually applies to Milgram’s subjects if we
don’t fully explore its limitations. I will argue that because of this external authoritative pressure,
Bok’s decisional conflict theory provides a limited view on the subjects’ decision-making process as
the additional pressure either aids to keep subjects in a decisional conflict or acts as the breaking point
for subjects to snap out of it.
