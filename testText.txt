participants were instructed to pull levers to inflict electric shocks on their opponents. According to the producers of the show, participants were unaware that contestants receiving shocks were actors and that there was no electrical current. Nevertheless 82% of people who played the “Game of Death” agreed to pull the lever. This macabre and widely publicised show highlights the enduring appeal of Stanley Milgram’s iconic 1963 study of “obedience to authority.”1 Milgram’s study is endlessly fascinating; seemingly capturing a century’s worth of state sanctioned, technologically mediated violence while apparently highlighting the relative ease with which “ordinary” citizens can be trans- formed into killers. Almost from the outset, the study seized the popular and academic imagination in a way that few other works of social science have. The public just never seem to tire of it; the “Game of Death” is only the latest in a long series of recreations, spoofs, and pop culture references (Blass, 2004; Miller, 1986).
